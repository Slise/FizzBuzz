# FizzBuzz
Assignment 1
Finished raw code for assignment 1, run succeeded but numbers are all on the same line
add "\n" to print statement to create new line for each
"Fizz" and "Buzz" prints working correctly however "FizzBuzz" is not recognized
Fizz and Buzz also does prints with the number associated with it
Revised if/else to have else output for number to resolve number being printed with the "Fizz" and "Buzz"
Moved the order of statement to get "FizzBuzz" to print from last to the 1st "if" statement due to a logic oversight
Success!
